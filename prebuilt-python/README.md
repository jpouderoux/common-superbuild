Prebuilt Python
===============

This project is used to generate pre-built Python binaries for Windows since
it requires Visual Studio 2008. It generates packages for any of the Python
projects enabled so that they may be used in other superbuilds without
requiring Visual Studio 2008 to be used for the entire build.
